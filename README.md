# Ros2-and-Gesture-control-robot
Robot control using hand gestures with computerÂ vision with ROS2 humble

The scope of this project involves the use of hand gestures obtained from user with the help of computer vision to control a mobile robot.
We also employed a safety mechanism that uses a sensor to detect an obstacles and halt execution of control commands from hand gestures to avoid crashes.
The entire project was executed with the use of ROS frame work integrated with hardware.
